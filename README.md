# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges! This collection showcases my solutions to the daily programming puzzles released throughout December 2024.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
```
AOC24/
├── data/       # Contains input data for each day's puzzle
└── src/        # Source code files for each solution
```
## Solutions

Each day's solution is implemented in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), a robust and efficient programming language. The solutions are located in the `src/` directory, with corresponding input data in the `data/` directory.

## Running the Solutions

1. Ensure [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) is installed on your system.

To execute all solutions:

2. Run the solution using Zig:
   ```sh
   zig build run
   ```
To execute a solution:

2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Run the solution using Zig:
   ```sh
   zig run dayX.zig
   ```
Replace XX with the day number (e.g., day1.zig for December 1st).

Happy coding!
